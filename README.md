Lightweight file watcher weighing about 300 LOC.
No runtime dependencies and no platform specific code.
Works everywhere.
Monitors changes in the file system by polling.
Has no config files.
Can be ran as daemon (background process).

## Installation

```bash
$ gem install filewatcher
```

or with `bundler`:

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem 'filewatcher'
```

## Usage

Watch a list of files and directories:

```ruby
require 'filewatcher'

Filewatcher.new(['lib/', 'Rakefile']).watch do |filename, event|
  puts "#{filename} #{event}"
end
```

Watch a single directory, for changes in all files and subdirectories:

```ruby
Filewatcher.new('lib/').watch do |filename, event|
  # ...
end
```

Notice that the previous is equivalent to the following:

```ruby
Filewatcher.new('lib/**/*').watch do |filename, event|
  # ...
end
```

Watch files and directories in the given directory - and not in subdirectories:

```ruby
Filewatcher.new('lib/*').watch do |filename, event|
  # ...
end
```

Watch an absolute directory:

```ruby
Filewatcher.new('/tmp/foo').watch do |filename, event|
  # ...
end
```

To detect if a file is updated, added or deleted:

```ruby
Filewatcher.new(['README.rdoc']).watch do |filename, event|
  puts "File #{event}: #{filename}"
end
```

When a file is renamed and `every` option is enabled, it is detected as
a new file followed by a file deletion:

```ruby
Filewatcher.new(['lib/'], every: true).watch do |filename, event|
  puts "File #{event}: #{filename}"
end

# Rename from `old_test.rb` to `new_test.rb` will print:

# File created: /absolute/path/lib/new_test.rb
# File deleted: /absolute/path/lib/old_test.rb
```

The API takes some of the same options as the command line interface.
To watch all files recursively except files that matches \*.rb
and only wait for 0.1 seconds between each scan:

```ruby
Filewatcher.new('**/*.*', exclude: '**/*.rb', interval: 0.1)
  .watch do |filename, event|
    puts filename
  end
```

Use patterns to match filenames in current directory and subdirectories.
The pattern is not a regular expression;
instead it follows rules similar to shell filename globbing.
See Ruby [documentation](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.1/File.html#method-c-fnmatch) for syntax.

```ruby
Filewatcher.new(['*.rb', '*.xml']).watch do |filename|
  puts "Updated #{filename}"
end
```

Start, pause, resume, stop, and finalize a running watch.
This is particularly useful when the update block takes a while to process each file
(e.g. sending over the network).

```ruby
filewatcher = Filewatcher.new(['*.rb'])
thread = Thread.new(filewatcher) { |fw| fw.watch{ |f| puts "Updated #{f}" } }
# ...
filewatcher.pause       # block stops responding to file system changes
filewatcher.finalize    # Ensure all file system changes made prior to
                        # pausing are handled.
# ...
filewatcher.resume      # block begins responding again, but is not given
                        # changes made between #pause_watch and
                        # #resume_watch
# ...
filewatcher.end         # block stops responding to file system changes
                        # and takes a final snapshot of the file system
thread.join

filewatcher.finalize    # Ensure all file system changes made prior to
                        # ending the watch are handled.
```

If basename, relative filename or absolute filename is necessary
use the standard [`pathname`](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/pathname/rdoc/Pathname.html)
like this:

```ruby
require 'pathname'

Filewatcher.new(['**/*.*']).watch do |filename, event|
  path = Pathname.new(filename)
  puts "Basename         : #{path.basename}"
  puts "Relative filename: #{File.join('.', path)}"
  puts "Absolute filename: #{path.realpath}"
end
```

### Plugins

You can require plugins for Filewatcher, which extends core functionality.

Example:

```ruby
require 'filewatcher'
require 'filewatcher-spinner'

# With the `true` value of option there will be an ASCII spinner in the STDOUT while waiting changes
Filewatcher.new('lib/', spinner: true).watch do |filename, event|
  puts "#{filename} #{event}"
end
```

Available methods are:

*   `#after_initialize`
*   `#before_pause_sleep`
*   `#before_resume_sleep`
*   `#after_stop`
*   `#finalizing`

## Credits

This project would not be where it is today without the generous help provided by people reporting issues and these contributors:

*   [Thomas Flemming](https://github.com/thomasfl): Original author. Restart option. Exported variables.

*   [Penn Taylor](https://github.com/penntaylor): Spinner displayed in the terminal and Start, pause, resume, stop, and finalize a running watch.

*   [Franco Leonardo Bulgarelli](https://github.com/flbulgarelli): Support for absolute and globbed paths.

*   [Kristoffer Roupé](https://github.com/kitofr): Command line globbing.

*   [Alexander Popov](https://github.com/AlexWayfer): Daemon mode, tests improvements, code style improvements, many other fixes and improvements.

This gem was initially inspired by [Tom Lieber's blog posting](http://alltom.com/pages/detecting-file-changes-with-ruby) ([Web Archive version](http://web.archive.org/web/20120208094934/http://alltom.com/pages/detecting-file-changes-with-ruby)).

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests

*   Fork the project.
*   Make your feature addition or bug fix.
*   Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
*   Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
*   Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
